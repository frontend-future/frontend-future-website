                Most people do not end up on this page because everything in life is perfect.

                You are here because something is not working anymore.

                Maybe you are tired of the long hours.

                Maybe the pay has hit a ceiling.

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Maybe you feel stuck in a role that never changes.

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Maybe you want more flexibility, more respect, or simply more control over your future.

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                And deep down, you know you are capable of more.

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                You just have not had the right path.

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed font-semibold mt-8">
                We built Frontend Future for people exactly like you.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Not for nineteen-year-olds with endless free time.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Not for college kids living in dorms.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                But for adults with jobs, families, bills, pressures, and responsibilities.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                People who need a way forward that actually fits their life.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed font-semibold mt-8">
                Here is the truth:
              </p>

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Tech is not out of reach.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                The path has just been hidden.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                And every year, college becomes less and less of the path.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Companies are no longer asking for degrees.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Tech CEOs openly say they care about skills, not diplomas.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                They want people who can build, solve problems, and work on real projects.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                They do not care where you went to school.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                They care whether you can do the job.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                This should be good news.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                It means the door has never been more open for people who want to make a change.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                The problem is that schools still teach people in all the wrong ways.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                They teach theory instead of real skills.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Homework instead of real projects.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Lectures instead of practical steps.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                And when students finish, they still have no idea how to get hired in the real world.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                We have been in those classrooms.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                We have seen the confusion.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                We have lived the experience of realizing that no one ever taught the part that actually matters.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Even with a top computer science education and experience as a teaching assistant, we saw firsthand how little of that knowledge translates to getting hired.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Learning coding in a classroom is not the same as doing the work companies expect.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Most people discover this too late.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed font-semibold mt-8">
                That is why Frontend Future exists.

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                To give you what traditional education never gave anyone.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                A clear roadmap so you always know exactly what to do next.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                A support system so you are never stuck or sitting alone on YouTube at two in the morning.
              </p>

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                A practical skillset built through job-like projects that translate into proof.

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                A realistic pace designed for adults who can give ten to twenty hours a week.

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                And a future with flexibility, comfort, and stability instead of stress and uncertainty.

                You do not need a degree.

                You do not need to quit your job.

                You do not need thousands of hours.

                What you need is a path you can follow.

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                A path that actually leads somewhere.

                And someone to guide you step by step so you do not get lost again.

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Frontend development can open doors to remote work, calmer schedules, higher pay ceilings, and real growth.
